# Federated ATT&CK Frontend

Federated ATT&CK is a tool designed to containerize the MITRE ATT&CK&reg; knowledge base, making ATT&CK easier to use and extend throughout the community. Our goal is to enable users of ATT&CK to easily instantiate their own copy of the ATT&CK knowledge base and provide the tools, infrastructure, and documentation to allow those organizations to both extend ATT&CK for their own needs and easily contribute to the ATT&CK knowledge base when appropriate.

The Federated ATT&CK Editor application is made up of several repositories:
- Federated ATT&CK Frontend: the front-end UI for the Federated ATT&CK Editor.
- [Federated ATT&CK Collection Manager](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/federated-attack-collection-manager): REST API and CLI for managing collections.
- [Federated ATT&CK REST API](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/federated-attack-rest-api): REST API service for storing, querying and editing ATT&CK objects.

For more documentation, please see the `docs` folder. The docs folder is also available in the in-app help page.
- [usage](/docs/usage.md): documentation about how to use the Federated ATT&CK Editor application.
- [changelog](/docs/changelog.md): documentation about updates to this application.
- [collections](/docs/collections.md): documentation about the collection data type.

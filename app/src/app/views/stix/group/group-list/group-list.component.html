                    Groups are sets of related intrusion activity that are tracked by a common name in the security community. Overlaps between names based on publicly reported associations are tracked using "Associated Groups" (also known as "Aliases").
                    <br><br>
                    Groups support the standard set of fields as well as the "Associated Groups" field. Each associated group is tracked using a name and description. The alias description is typically used to hold a set of citations, though plain-text can also be entered alongside citations if additional context is necessary. Alias names cannot be changed after they are added, but the description can be changed by clicking on the entry in the associated groups list.
